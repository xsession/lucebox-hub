> A 33B-total mixture-of-experts only fires ~8 of 256 experts per token, but a naive hot/cold offload still pays for it: pick the wrong experts to keep resident and you hit the CPU tier a third of the time. Spark exploits **activation sparsity** as a product: it calibrates the hot set from the traffic you actually serve, then a bounded GPU cache swaps the long tail in and out so cold-misses fall to ~zero, all inside a fixed VRAM budget.

## What Spark is

Spark is the **placement + caching layer** on top of the merged hot/cold MoE
offload engine in [`../../server/`](../../server/). The engine knows how to split
experts hot (GPU) / cold (CPU) and compute the cold ones. Spark makes that
actually fast on a small card:

1. **Calibrated placement.** The expert that *should* be hot is the one your
   traffic routes to most. Spark replays real sessions through the daemon,
   accumulates per-(layer, expert) routing frequencies, and emits a placement
   profile. Loading it cuts the cold-hit rate from **36% (uniform) to 6.6%** on
   held-out sessions and lifts decode **66 → 81 tok/s** at the same VRAM.
2. **A bounded expert cache.** Calibration is static; real generations still hit
   a per-session tail. A fixed ring of spare GPU slots swaps cold experts in on
   first use (LRU evict) and serves them on-GPU afterward. The distinct cold set
   saturates within a session, so a small cache drives cold-misses to ~0 and
   recovers most of the remaining gap (**81 → 88 tok/s**) without growing VRAM.
3. **A pre-gate predictor (research).** The last ~20% to all-GPU needs the
   per-layer graphs fused, which needs experts known one step early. We capture
   routing traces and train a predictor; the finding (below) is that this needs
   a model fine-tune, not a fitted predictor.

It generalizes beyond experts: the same hot/cold residency applies to
fine-grain neuron sparsity (Deja Vu / PowerInfer style). MoE experts are the
coarse-grain case Spark ships today.

## Results

Full tables and methodology in [RESULTS.md](RESULTS.md). Single RTX 3090,
Laguna-XS.2 Q4_K_M, 333-chunk / ~171K-token calibration corpus from real Claude
Code sessions, validated on 60 held-out sessions.

| Config (held-out) | tok/s | % all-GPU | cold-hit | VRAM |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| All-GPU | 111 | 100% | - | 18.8 GiB |
| Uniform 60% | 66 | 59% | 36% | 10.6 GiB |
| **Spark calibrated 60%** | **81** | 73% | 6.6% | 10.6 GiB |
| **Spark + cache (32 slots)** | **85-88** | ~79% | ~0% | **14.6 GiB** |

Peak VRAM at the operating point (60% hot + 32 cache slots) measured at
**14.59 GiB** — a 33B-total MoE at ~85-88 tok/s, under 16 GiB.

```

The hot tier is pinned from calibration; the cache ring is a small over-allocation
of the hot expert stack, so a swap is "copy 3 weight tensors into a spare slot +
update one routing LUT entry" and the existing GPU FFN serves it with no special
path. Cold experts that are never cached fall back to the engine's CPU path.

## Serve it: one self-tuning command

For production, you don't run any of the offline pipeline. `dflash_server`
auto-tunes from its own traffic:

```bash
dflash_server <model.gguf> --spark            # laguna or qwen35moe MoE
```

`--spark` (optionally `--spark-slots N`, default 32):
- enables the **bounded expert cache** (auto-tunes the working set at serve time),
- **auto-loads** a learned placement profile from `<model>.gguf.spark.csv` if present,
- keeps **persisting** that profile after every request from live routing.

First boot starts uniform and warms the cache within a session; each restart
loads a better profile and starts warmer. No corpus, no CSV juggling, no env
vars. Verified on RTX 3090 for **both** Laguna-XS.2 and Qwen3.6-35B-A3B: the
profile is written, reloaded (`source=hotness:...`), and generation stays
coherent under offload.

The offline pipeline below is for **bootstrapping** a profile before first serve
(e.g. from your own Claude Code sessions) and for **evaluation**. It is optional.

## Bootstrapping / eval pipeline

The tooling here drives the dflash daemon (`test_dflash`); build it from
[`../../server/`](../../server/) first.

```bash
cd optimizations/spark
uv sync                                   # tokenizers (+ gguf/torch optional extras)

# 0. one tokenizer, extracted from the GGUF (gpt2 byte-level BPE)
python -m spark.tokenizer --gguf laguna-xs2-Q4_K_M.gguf --out laguna_tok.json

# 1. corpus from your agent sessions (train / held-out split, by session)
python -m spark.extract_sessions --sessions-dir ~/.claude/projects --out-dir ./corpus

# 2. calibrate the placement profile (routing is placement-independent, so a
#    high budget calibrates fast)
python -m spark.calibrate \
    --bin ../../server/build/test_dflash --gguf laguna-xs2-Q4_K_M.gguf \
    --tok laguna_tok.json --corpus corpus/train.jsonl --out-profile spark_profile.csv

# 3. validate on held-out sessions: uniform vs calibrated vs + cache
python -m spark.validate --bin ../../server/build/test_dflash \
    --gguf laguna-xs2-Q4_K_M.gguf --tok laguna_tok.json \
    --corpus corpus/test.jsonl --budget-pct 60                       # uniform
python -m spark.validate ... --budget-pct 60 --hotness spark_profile.csv        # calibrated
python -m spark.validate ... --budget-pct 60 --hotness spark_profile.csv --cache-slots 32
```

Deploy: run the daemon with `DFLASH_EXPERT_BUDGET_PCT=60
DFLASH_LAGUNA_HOTNESS=spark_profile.csv` and, for the cache,
`DFLASH_LAGUNA_EXPERT_CACHE=1 DFLASH_LAGUNA_CACHE_SLOTS=32`.

## Engine knobs

Placement uses the merged hybrid-offload engine; the cache + trace are the Spark
engine additions. All on the daemon process.

| Env var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DFLASH_EXPERT_BUDGET_PCT` | hot-tier VRAM budget (% of experts resident) |
| `DFLASH_LAGUNA_HOTNESS` | placement profile CSV from `spark.calibrate` |
| `DFLASH_LAGUNA_NEXT_PLACEMENT_OUT` | accumulate + dump a routing profile (calibration) |
| `DFLASH_LAGUNA_EXPERT_CACHE` / `_CACHE_SLOTS` | enable the bounded cache + slots/layer |
| `DFLASH_LAGUNA_GPU_REMAP` | unified GPU FFN the cache serves through |
| `DFLASH_LAGUNA_PREGATE_TRACE` / `_MAX` | capture `(hidden -> experts)` traces (research) |

## What's ours, what isn't

The hot/cold MoE offload engine (placement, storage, swap, cold compute) is the
substrate, merged in [`../../server/src/common/moe_hybrid_*`](../../server/src/common/).
Spark is the calibration + bounded cache + predictor on top.

The sparsity-offload ideas are not ours:
- [**Pre-gated MoE**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12066) (Hwang et al, ISCA 2024): decouple gating from execution, prefetch next-block experts.
- [**ProMoE**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22134) / [**Fate**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12224): learned predictor + proactive GPU caching, cross-layer gate prefetch.
- [**Deja Vu**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17157) (Liu et al, ICML 2023) / [**PowerInfer**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12456) / [**LLM in a Flash**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11514): contextual / neuron-grain activation sparsity with hot/cold residency.

What we built:
- A traffic-calibrated placement pipeline keyed on real agent sessions, with a held-out split.
- A bounded LRU expert cache (spare-slot swap) wired through the engine's GPU FFN, so cold-misses fall to ~0 in fixed VRAM.
- A pre-gate trace capture + trainer, and the measurement of where fitted prediction tops out.

## Scope and limits

- **Single 24 GB GPU**, Laguna-XS.2 Q4_K_M is the validated target. Other MoEs need re-calibration.
- **Calibrate on the traffic you serve.** A profile from one distribution under-performs on another (conversation-calibrated vs pure-code: 6.6% vs 16% cold).
- **Locality required.** The cache wins because agent traffic has a small, stable working set; a no-locality workload thrashes toward PCIe-bound.
- **Full all-GPU speed needs a model change.** A fitted pre-gate caps at ~53% recall@8 (the pre/post-attention information gap); closing it means fine-tuning the gate, not a bigger predictor. See [RESULTS.md](RESULTS.md) §4.
