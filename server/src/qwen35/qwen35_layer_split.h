// Qwen35 multi-GPU layer-split daemon entry point.
//
// Shards the target model across multiple GPUs by layer ranges.
// Each shard gets its own CUDA backend, partial weights, and KV cache.
// Activations are transferred between shards at shard boundaries.
//
// NOTE: The full implementation currently lives in test/test_dflash.cpp
// (run_target_layer_split_daemon) because it depends on many helpers and
// globals defined there. This header defines the DevicePlacement-based
// args struct as the migration target. The implementation will move here
// once the helper functions (run_qwen35_layer_split_forward, etc.) are
// extracted to src/qwen35/.
